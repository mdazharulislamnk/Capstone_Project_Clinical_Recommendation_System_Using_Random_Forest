# Capstone Project - Clinical Recommendation System Using Rando Forest

A full-stack machine learning web application that provides clinical recommendations (Tests, Medicines, Dosages, Suggestions) based on user-input symptoms. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and trained with a Random Forest model.


## Features

- Accepts multiple symptoms as input.
- Predicts tests, medicines, dosages, and suggestions using a trained ML model.
- Allows users to manually add/edit recommendations.
- Generates PDF reports from selected suggestions.
- Built-in clear/reset functionality.
- User-friendly frontend with interactive features.


## üíª Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, Pickle
- **PDF Generation:** jsPDF
